The Ultimate DogeWatch
========

A natively working Pebble Version 2 watchface that displays the Dogecoin network statistics (Current Block, Difficulty, and Global Hashrate), along with the current DOGE/BTC price (via Prelude.io) and the current DOGE/USD price (displayed as $X.XXX / 1000 DOGE). The details currently update every 5 minutes, but I plan to add an option to allow the user to change the interval. 

The APIs that I am using for the watch are from two very reliable sources. 
The Network statistics: DogeChain.info
The Prices: Prelude.io


I hope to get a download link up when I finish ironing out all the issues. 


This watchface is becoming a modified version of github.com/johanso-au/DogeMiner . I plan to integrate my own code and add more features, though I did use that app as a starting foundation. 


Any donations to help this watchface grow would be greatly appreciated (DNf3vALx3sufWiYoqePgcjL9XBqvJXwuAq), as I am quite a poor college shibe. 


Recent Updates
========
I have not worked on this project for a very long time. Since then, Prelude.io is no longer in business, and I bet DogeChain.info has changed their API. I am no longer working on the watchface. I will release a tag with a binary for the current state of the watchface. (this paragrah added 8/21/15)
