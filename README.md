The Ultimate DogeWatch
========

A natively working Pebble Version 2 watchface that displays the Dogecoin network statistics (Current Block, Difficulty, and Global Hashrate), along with the current DOGE/BTC price (via Prelude.io) and the current DOGE/USD price (displayed as $X.XXX / 1000 DOGE). The details currently update every 5 minutes, but I plan to add an option to allow the user to change the interval. 

The APIs that I am using for the watch are from two very reliable sources. 
The Network statistics: DogeChain.info
The Prices: Prelude.io


I hope to get a download link up when I finish ironing out all the issues. 


This watchface is becoming a modified version of github.com/johanso-au/DogeMiner . I plan to integrate my own code and add more features, though I did use that app as a starting foundation. 


Any donations to help this watchface grow would be greatly appreciated (DNf3vALx3sufWiYoqePgcjL9XBqvJXwuAq), as I am quite a poor college shibe. 



How to install:
=======

At the time of writing (Jan 2014), the Pebble SDK2 was only available to developers and is not yet on Google Play or the Apple Store. Should you wish to use this watchface now, you will need to aquire the Pebble V2 app for your device from Pebble.

Installation is simple enough. Download the face from the link below (or from the Pebble App Store once available) from your phone with the Pebble App installed. This will automatically install the watchface and display it.
